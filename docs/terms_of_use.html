      <h3>LIABILITY</h3>
      <p>If I fail to comply with these Terms I are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of my breaking these Terms or my failing to use reasonable care and skill, but subject to paragraph 14.4, I are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these Terms, both I and you knew it might happen (“Foreseeable Losses”); and</p>
      <p>Subject to paragraph 14.4, I limit my aggregate liability for Foreseeable Losses, arising out of or in connection with these Terms, to you in respect of all events occurring in any calendar year, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), for breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, to the greater of:</p>

        <li>any loss or damage (including to any device or content belonging to you) caused by us to the extent that such loss or damage results from ymy negligence, ymy failure to follow my reasonable instructions or any other breach of these Terms (or any other contract you have in place with us), unless I were in breach of a legal obligation or duty of care owed to you by us and that breach is the substantial cause of the loss or damage;</li>
        <li>any loss or damage caused by any error, bugs or viruses arising in ymy use of my Apps that are not directly caused by or attributable to my Apps, or any incompatibility of my Apps with any other software, hardware or material on ymy device; and</li>
        <li>any breach of paragraphs 6 or 10 by you.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits my liability for death or personal injury arising from my negligence, or my fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under English law.</p>
      <p>If defective digital content that I have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, I will either repair the damage or pay you compensation.

      <p>My Apps are for domestic and private use only. If you use my Apps for any commercial, business or resale purpose I will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
      <p>Please note that in some jurisdictions consumer protection laws may not allow certain disclaimers or exclusions or limitations of liability and consequently some of the disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability in these Terms may not apply.</p>
      <p>I recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection with my Apps, to protect yourself in case of problems with my Apps.</p>
      <p>My Apps have not been developed to meet ymy individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of my Apps (as described on the app stores where ours Apps are available and in the related documentation) meet ymy requirements.</p>
      <p>If my provision of support for my Apps is delayed by an event outside my control then I will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and I will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided I do this I will not be liable for delays caused by the event but you may terminate these Terms by ceasing to use my Apps and deleting or removing it from ymy device.</p>
      <p>My Apps, which are available on various app stores, are controlled and offered by us from my facilities in United Kingdom. The distribution of my Apps via app stores is governed by their rules with which I must comply. There are some locations where Apps with paid for in-app purchasing products are not permitted and therefore in those locations my Apps will not be visible to app store users registered in those locations.</p>
      <p>You agree that you will compensate us for any losses (including reasonable legal fees) that I incur as a result of any breach of paragraph 6 or 10 by you.</p>

      <p>If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using my Apps.</p>
      <p>Changes to my Apps will not prevent my Apps working with the versions of the operating system shown on the app store that you downloaded the App from.</p>

      <h3>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h3>
      <p>These Terms may only be modified with my prior written consent. I may alter or amend these Terms, including introducing new terms, that are:</p>
      (a) the result of a change in applicable law or my business;
      (b) necessary for the provision of my Apps; or
      (c) the result of any improvements to my Apps.
      <p>Subject to paragraph 20.3, if I make any changes (including any changes to my policies), I will give thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to you by email. If you notify us in writing within the thirty (30) days that you do not accept the change, these Terms will terminate immediately. However, if you continue to use my Apps after providing such notice or after the thirty (30) day period, you are accepting these Terms as updated.</p>

      <h3>TRANSFER OF RIGHTS</h3>
      <p>I may transfer my rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. I will always tell you in writing if this happens and I will ensure that the transfer will not affect ymy rights under the these Terms.</p>
      <p>You may only transfer ymy rights or ymy obligations under these Terms to another person if I agree in writing.</p>

      <h3>TERMINATION</h3>
      <p>These Terms apply from when you click “I Accept” at the bottom of this screen (the “Effective Date”) and will remain in full force and effect while you use my Apps until terminated in accordance with this paragraph 22.</p>
      <p>I may terminate these Terms and ymy use of my Apps, or suspend ymy use of my Apps, immediately by written notice to you if:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>I consider that you have used my Apps in violation of these Terms;</li>
        <li>I believe there has been unauthorised access to my Apps;</li>
        <li>we, at my sole discretion, decide to withdraw my Apps (whether in whole or in part);</li>
        <li>I have a legal or regulatory obligation imposed on us, which impacts my ability to provide my Apps; or</li>
        <li>for any other reason provided that I have given you thirty (30) days’ written notice by email, SMS or via an electronic communication within my Apps.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I may discontinue licensing any of the App Content at any time at my sole discretion. In this instance you will be able to continue to use my Apps with the App Content, but it will no longer be available on app stores and will no longer be supported by us.</p>
      <p>You can terminate these Terms by ceasing to use my Apps and deleting or uninstalling it from ymy device.</p>
      <p>Upon termination for any reason:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>all rights granted to you under these Terms cease (however, any liabilities incurred by you under these Terms prior shall survive any such termination);</li>
        <li>you must cease all activities authorised by these Terms; and</li>
        <li>you must delete or remove my Apps from ymy device.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>GENERAL</h3>
      <p>This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to allow anyone other than you or us to enforce any term of these Terms or of the Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Even if I delay in enforcing this contract, I can still enforce it later. If I do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if I delay in taking steps against you in respect of ymy breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
      <p>These Terms are governed by English law (including non-contractual disputes or claims) and legal proceedings in respect of these Terms and my Apps shall be dealt with exclusively by the English courts.</p>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the relevant provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, and the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <p>Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that I may have, you acknowledge and agree that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of these Terms by you. Accordingly, I shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of these Terms.</p>
